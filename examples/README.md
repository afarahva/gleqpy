Examples
========

**1D** - contains a script which runs a 1D GLE simulation with a simple memory kernel, 
then calculates the memory kernel from the output velocities/forces, and compares the 
input memory kernel to the calculated one.

**ase** - contains files for running a simple simulation of a surface slab and extracting 
GLE parameters for the motion of surface sites. 

**lammps** - contains files for running a simple simulation of a ion + water box and 
extracting GLE parameters for the motion of the ions.

**proj** - contains an example of how to calculate a surface site memory kernel using 
projection operators.

`sim.py` - Run this first, it runs a short simulation of a SPC/E + ion water box and 
outputs positions/velocities/forces at a 5fs interval

`ion_potentials.py` - Interaction potentials/forces between monatomic ion pairs.

`ion_explicit.dat` - Datafile for 1 2.5nm 1M SPC/E + LiCl simulation.

`ion_implicit.dat` - Datafile for LiCl simulation in vacuum/implicit solvent.
